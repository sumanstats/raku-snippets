### My emacs initialisation file for running R in Emacs with ESS



For this install `company` mode, `ess`, `solarised theme`, `elpy`, `yasnippet-snippets`, `smartparens-config` and `lsp-mode`. Put this configuration in `init.el` inside `.emacs.d` directory.

```
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))
(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
